  "description": "Clean Architecture is a software design paradigm that emphasizes separation of concerns and maintainability by structuring systems into layers where each layer serves a specific purpose and is independent of implementation details. At its core, Clean Architecture advocates for decoupling business logic from frameworks, databases, and other external dependencies, promoting testability, flexibility, and scalability. The architecture typically consists of concentric layers, with the innermost layer containing entities representing business objects and use cases, surrounded by layers for interfaces, application logic, and external frameworks or drivers. This approach encourages a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to understand, modify, and extend software systems over time.",
